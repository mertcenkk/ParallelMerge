# Parallel Merge Sort Algorithm

In this project, I aimed to process data with multiple CPUs.
Merge sort is running recursively so I had to interrupt this process in a stage.
So I wrote another recursive function that gonna divide data into processes and 
each process going to run with its data in them and they are going to return this data by merging.
